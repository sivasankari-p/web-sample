This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Follow the steps below to build your react app on top of this base :

#### 1. Move into your project folder
`cd <<your_project_folder>>`
#### 2. Add base remote to your project
`git remote add base https://gitlab.prod.fedex.com/3800184/crs-react-redux-base.git`
#### 3. Fetch the new remote into your working folder
`git fetch base`
#### 4. Pull the base commits into your HEAD
`git pull base master`
#### 5. Push into your remote, so you get the base code with all commits preserved
`git push <<your_remote>> <<your_branch>>`
